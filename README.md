Depending on the source material you’re reading, you may hear that Cantonese has six or nine tones (sometimes even more), but per contemporary linguists, Cantonese is a six-tone system, as follows:

1st tone: high level  |  si1 (撕) - rip; tear




2nd tone: high rising  |  si2 (史) - history




3rd tone: mid level  |  si3 (試) - try out, attempt




4th tone: mid-low to low drop |  si4 (時) - time




5th tone: low raising  | si5 (市) - market, city




6th tone: mid-low level  | si6 (事) - matter, trouble
